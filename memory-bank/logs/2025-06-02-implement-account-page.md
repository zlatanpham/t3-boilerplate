TaskRef: "Implement /account page with user name edit functionality"

Learnings:

- Successfully implemented a new protected page (`/account`) in a Next.js App Router structure, including a client-side component (`EditNameDialog`) using `react-hook-form`, `zod` for validation, and `sonner` for toasts.
- Implemented a new tRPC router (`user.ts`) with a `protectedProcedure` for updating user data in Prisma, and integrated it into the `root.ts`.
- Confirmed that `getServerAuthSession` is not directly exported from `src/server/auth/index.ts`; instead, `auth()` should be used to retrieve the session.
- Resolved ESLint errors related to preferring nullish coalescing (`??`) over logical OR (`||`) and correctly escaping apostrophes (`'`).
- Resolved TypeScript errors concerning implicit `any` types (by explicitly typing `n: string` in `map` functions) and ensuring type-only imports (`import type`).
- Encountered and pragmatically resolved a complex type incompatibility issue with `TRPCClientError<AppRouter>` in the `onError` callback of `useMutation` by casting to `any`. This indicates a potential area for further investigation into tRPC's specific error typing or a need for a dedicated utility type.
- Verified the `User` model in `prisma/schema.prisma` correctly includes a `name` field.
- Successfully added a new navigation item to `src/components/app-sidebar.tsx` for the new `/account` page.

Difficulties:

- Initial `replace_in_file` operations failed due to subtle mismatches caused by auto-formatting and exact content requirements. This necessitated breaking down changes into smaller, more precise `SEARCH/REPLACE` blocks and careful verification against the `final_file_content`.
- The `TRPCClientError` type incompatibility in `useMutation`'s `onError` callback was challenging to resolve without resorting to `any`, suggesting a deeper type system interaction or a specific tRPC pattern that was not immediately apparent.

Successes:

- All core functionalities and UI elements for the `/account` page were successfully implemented and integrated.
- Iterative debugging and precise application of `replace_in_file` allowed for successful resolution of multiple ESLint and TypeScript errors.
- The project's existing structure and coding standards were maintained throughout the implementation.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- **General Pattern: tRPC `useMutation` Error Handling:** For `onError` callbacks in `useMutation`, if `TRPCClientError<AppRouter>` causes type incompatibility, consider using `any` as a temporary pragmatic solution, but note this as an area for future investigation into more precise tRPC utility types or patterns.
- **General Pattern: `replace_in_file` Precision:** Always refer to the `final_file_content` after any file modification. For complex changes, break them into multiple, smaller `SEARCH/REPLACE` blocks to minimize errors and simplify debugging.
- **Project Specific: Next-Auth Session Retrieval:** Use `auth()` from `@/server/auth` instead of `getServerAuthSession` for fetching the session.

TaskRef: "Implement lazy data fetching for tools export on account page"

Learnings:

- Successfully implemented lazy data fetching using `api.tool.getAllByUserId.useQuery(undefined, { enabled: false })` and `refetch` in a Next.js component with tRPC.
- The `refetch` function from `useQuery` can be awaited to get the fetched data directly (e.g., `const { data: fetchedTools } = await refetchTools();`).
- Updated the logic to use the `fetchedTools` data after the `refetch` call to ensure the export functionality operates on the newly fetched data.

Difficulties:

- Initially considered `useLazyQuery` but realized `useQuery` with `enabled: false` and `refetch` is the standard and more direct approach for tRPC/React Query for manual data fetching.

Successes:

- Achieved the user's requirement of not prefetching data on page load and fetching only on button click.
- Maintained the loading state and confirmation dialog logic correctly, adapting it to the manual fetch pattern.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: Lazy data fetching in tRPC/React Query using `enabled: false` and `refetch()`.
- Specific: How to integrate `refetch()` with existing logic that depends on the fetched data, ensuring the correct data is used after the manual fetch.

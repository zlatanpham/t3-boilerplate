TaskRef: "Add tool count column and tool list drawer to API keys table"

Learnings:
  - Successfully modified tRPC `apiKey` router to include nested `_count` for tools within projects for `getAll` procedure.
  - Implemented a new tRPC procedure `getToolsByApiKeyId` to fetch tools grouped by project for a given API key. This involved querying `Project`s related to the `ApiKey` and including their `Tool`s.
  - Created a new React component `ApiKeyToolsDrawer` using Shadcn UI's `Sheet` to display the grouped tools on the right side of the window.
  - Integrated the new drawer component and the tool count display into `src/app/(protected)/api-keys/page.tsx`, making the count clickable to open the drawer.
  - Learned how to sum nested counts from Prisma query results in the frontend.
  - Corrected the usage of `Highlight` component to pass content as `children` instead of a `text` prop.
  - Implemented scrollability for the tool listing container within the drawer.
  - Removed the redundant close button from the drawer footer.
  - Updated the "Tool Count" column label to "Tools" and wrapped the count in a Shadcn `Badge` component with a `Wrench` icon, matching the style of project cards.

Difficulties:
  - Initially considered adding a direct `tools` relation to `ApiKey` in `prisma/schema.prisma`, but realized it was incorrect due to the many-to-many relationship between `ApiKey` and `Project`, and one-to-many between `Project` and `Tool`. The correct approach was to handle the aggregation and fetching logic in the tRPC router.
  - Encountered a TypeScript error when using the `Highlight` component due to incorrect prop usage, which was resolved by checking the component's expected props.
  - Faced a temporary rendering issue where the drawer only showed one project's tools, which was resolved by confirming the backend data structure and frontend rendering logic.

Successes:
  - The implementation followed the planned architecture, ensuring efficient data fetching (tool count with `getAll`, detailed tools on demand).
  - The UI integration is seamless with existing Shadcn components and now adheres to user's specific layout and styling requests, including the badge and icon for the tool count.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
  - Pattern: Handling nested counts and aggregations in tRPC/Prisma for complex relationships.
  - Pattern: Lazy loading detailed data (drawer content) only when needed.
  - UI/UX: Best practices for drawer/sheet components (placement, scrollability, button redundancy).
  - Component Usage: Always verify component props by reading the component's definition file.
  - Consistency: Applying consistent UI patterns (e.g., badge for counts) across different parts of the application.

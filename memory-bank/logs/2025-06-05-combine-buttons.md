TaskRef: "Combine three buttons into one button with dropdown action"

Learnings:
  - Successfully refactored three individual buttons ("Export Tools", "Import Tools", "Move Tools") into a single "Tools" dropdown button using Shadcn UI's `DropdownMenu` component.
  - Integrated `DropdownMenuTrigger`, `DropdownMenuContent`, and `DropdownMenuItem` to encapsulate the existing dialog triggers.
  - Added `ChevronDown` icon from `lucide-react` to visually indicate the dropdown functionality.
  - The `onSelect` prop of `DropdownMenuItem` was used to open the respective dialogs by setting their `isOpen` state to `true`.

Difficulties:
  - None encountered. The Shadcn UI components provided a straightforward way to achieve the desired UI change.

Successes:
  - Improved UI by consolidating multiple actions into a single, cleaner dropdown.
  - Maintained existing functionality of export, import, and move tools dialogs.
  - Adhered to Shadcn UI design principles.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
  - General pattern: Consolidating multiple related actions into a single dropdown menu using Shadcn UI components (`DropdownMenu`, `DropdownMenuTrigger`, `DropdownMenuContent`, `DropdownMenuItem`) for improved UI/UX.

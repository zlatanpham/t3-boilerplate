TaskRef: "Fix compile error: useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary"

Learnings:
  - The `useSearchParams` hook in Next.js App Router client components requires a Suspense boundary in the parent layout to prevent compile errors related to streaming and server-side rendering.
  - The error message "useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary" directly indicates the need for a `Suspense` component.
  - Placing the `Suspense` component around `children` in the relevant `layout.tsx` file is the correct approach for page-level components.

Difficulties:
  - None. The error message was clear and the solution straightforward.

Successes:
  - Successfully identified the cause of the compile error.
  - Correctly implemented the `Suspense` boundary in the appropriate layout file.
  - Resolved the compile error without introducing new issues.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
  - General pattern: Handling `useSearchParams` in Next.js App Router client components by wrapping with `Suspense` in the layout.

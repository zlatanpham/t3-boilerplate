TaskRef: "Add slide-down animation to collapsible block and 'move from bottom to top' animation to user message in chat-message-display.tsx"

Learnings:

- Successfully integrated `framer-motion` to create a slide-down animation for a `Collapsible` component.
- Used `motion.div` with `initial={{ opacity: 0, height: 0 }}`, `animate={{ opacity: 1, height: "auto" }}`, and `exit={{ opacity: 0, height: 0 }}` for the collapsible animation.
- Set `transition={{ duration: 0.3, ease: "easeInOut" }}` for a smooth effect on the collapsible.
- Added `className="overflow-hidden"` to the `motion.div` wrapping the collapsible to prevent content from overflowing during the height animation.
- Implemented a "move from bottom to top" animation for user messages using `motion.div` with `initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}` and `animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}`.
- Used `transition={{ duration: 0.3, ease: "easeOut" }}` for the user message animation to give it a quick, natural feel.

Difficulties:

- Initial misunderstanding of the user's desired animation for user messages (pop-up vs. move from bottom). Resolved by clarifying the animation type.

Successes:

- Both requested animations were implemented successfully, enhancing the visual experience of chat messages.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: Using `framer-motion` for slide-down/up animations with `height: "auto"` and `overflow-hidden`.
- General pattern: Using `framer-motion` for "move from bottom to top" animations with `y` and `opacity` for new elements.

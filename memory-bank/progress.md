## What Works

- **API Keys Table Enhancement:**
  - The API keys table now includes a "Tools" column displaying the count of associated tools.
  - Clicking the tool count opens a side drawer (`Sheet`) that lists all tools, grouped by their respective projects.
  - Tool names within the drawer are highlighted using the `Highlight` component.
  - The tool list within the drawer is scrollable.
  - The tool count is displayed within a `Badge` component with a `Wrench` icon, consistent with the project card style.
- **Login Form Client-Side Error Handling:**
  - The login form (`src/components/login-form.tsx`) is now a client component.
  - It uses `useTransition` for pending state during login attempts.
  - It displays toast notifications for login failures using `sonner`.
  - Login logic is encapsulated in a server action (`src/app/actions/auth.ts`) to prevent client-side bundling issues.
  - The `Toaster` component is correctly integrated into `src/app/(public)/layout.tsx`.

## What's Left to Build

- Verify the toast functionality by attempting to log in with invalid credentials.
- Ensure no unexpected redirects occur on login failure.

## Current Status

The initial implementation for client-side toast notifications on login failure is complete. The next step is to verify its functionality.

## Known Issues

- Unexpected redirect to GitHub login page on invalid credentials, despite `redirect: false` in `signIn`. This needs further investigation and resolution.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Initial decision to add a direct `tools` relation to `ApiKey` in Prisma was revised to a more appropriate approach of fetching nested counts and detailed tool data via tRPC procedures, ensuring correct data modeling and efficient data retrieval.
- The choice of Shadcn UI's `Drawer` was refined to `Sheet` for better side panel presentation, and further UI/UX improvements were made based on user feedback (highlighting tool names, scrollability, removing redundant buttons).
- Refactored `signIn` calls from client component directly into a dedicated server action to resolve "Code generation for chunk item errored" and ensure proper server-side execution of Prisma-related logic.
- Adopted explicit error checking of `signIn`'s `SignInResponse` object to correctly propagate authentication errors to the client for toast display.
